## Building
For building Buoh, you will need `meson`, `ninja` and `pkg-config`, as well as the following libraries with their development headers.

* `glib2`
* `gtk3`
* `libxml2`
* `libsoup`

Then you can build and install Buoh like [any other meson project](http://mesonbuild.com/Quick-guide.html#compiling-a-meson-project):

```
meson build --prefix=/usr
ninja -C build
ninja -C build install
```

Alternately, with [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/nix/), you can just run `nix-shell` in the project directory, and it will drop you into a shell with all the required dependencies.
